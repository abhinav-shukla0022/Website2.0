            <p>Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.

                Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.
                
                There are two major Python versions: Python 2 and Python 3. Both are quite different.

        <h1>CSS- Cascading Style Sheets
        </h1>
        <br>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.

            CSS gives developers the ability to change the linear layout of a page — the order of elements on a Web page when all styles and formatting are removed — without altering its visual layout.

        <br>
        <p>The Full Form Of JS is Javascript
            JS stands for JavaScript. It is a text-based, lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted scripting programming language. This language is very popular for developing web pages. It can be used both on the client-side and server-side. Basically, this scripting language not only helps in developing the web pages but also makes the web pages more interactive and attractive to engage the user. 
            It allows developers to create dynamically updating content, use animations, pop-up menus, clickable buttons, control multimedia, etc
